# final-fantasy

Explores indie game design and development through an [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) machine and visualizer. 

Let's face it - you probably won't get to use Typescript & Styled Components at your day job so you might as well weekend-warrior it and build something fun while learning something that can be applied to any app; prepare for that day when you do.
